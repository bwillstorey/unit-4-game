## About
- A basic hidden number guessing game built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery. A random number between 19 - 120 is generated that the user is to match by clicking on crystal images with hidden values assigned to each image. The viewport updates on each click event to reflect the user's current score. Matching the random number and current score wins the round, which is also tallied in the viewport.
